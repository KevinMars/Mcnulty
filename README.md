I worked with Census Data from the Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota to predict if someone owns a home or rents one. Using features such as education, age, and state I was able to predict homeownership with ~80% accuracy compared to the baseline of 66%.

my_web_app.py is a web app made with Flask that allows you to adjust different features such as age and income to see it's effect on predicting whether someone is a homeowner.

The two d3 graphs show the age and education level of homeowners vs renters. The black line depicts renters.
